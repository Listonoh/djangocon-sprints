Notes for "Getting started contributing to Django" sprints workshop.


The canonical docs here are [the Contributing Guide](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/).
The link there is to the index page. There's a lot to it!

Two good starting points are:

* [Advice for new contributors](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/new-contributors/)
* [Writing your first patch for Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/contributing/) (Tutorial)
